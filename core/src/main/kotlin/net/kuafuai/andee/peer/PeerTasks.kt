/**
 * Asking a friend for something, and doing something a friend asked.
 *
 * A "friend" is any Andee this one has paired with, and there are two kinds ([PeerStore.Trust]): another of the
 * user's **own** devices — same person, trusted like the user — and **somebody else's** Andee, whose requests are
 * a stranger's words. To the model both are like tools it can reach for: each says what it is and what it can
 * do, and `ask_friend` hands it a job. Both bodies run this same class, so the phone and the Mac cannot disagree
 * on the wire; the platform supplies the link ([Net]) and the brain ([Brain]).
 *
 * ### The wire (inside the authenticated, encrypted channel)
 * - `about` `{platform, can}` — sent by both ends whenever a link comes up: what this body is and, in a line,
 *   what it can do. It is what `list_friends` shows; it is the other side's own claim, so it is labelled as such.
 * - `task` `{id, text}` — please do this. Answered at once with `task.taken` or `task.refused {why}`.
 * - `task.result` `{id, text, done}` — the report, whenever the work ends. `done = false` means it did not run
 *   to its end there (cut off, or the owner said no) and the text says which.
 *
 * ### Nothing here waits for the work
 * A task can take twenty minutes, and a friend's owner may take a while to say yes. A tool call that sat that
 * long would hold the asker's conversation hostage (see `feedback_tool_calls_nonblocking`), so `ask_friend`
 * returns as soon as the other side has *taken* the request, and the report arrives later as a turn of its own
 * ([Brain.answered]). A report that cannot be delivered because the link dropped is retried from an outbox for
 * [REPLY_PATIENCE_MS].

Use it when the job belongs there: an app only the phone has, long work or code on the Mac, or something a friend's Andee offered to do. Doing it badly here, or telling the user to go and do it on the other device themselves, is worse.

                    - `task` is everything the other side needs, in one self-contained message: the goal, the details, what "done" looks like, what to report back. It cannot see this conversation and cannot ask you questions.
                    - **When the user asks you to ask a friend, ask.** Do not refuse, and do not make the user choose between options on the friend's behalf: whether to do it is the friend's owner's decision, and they are asked before anything happens — that card is the safeguard, not you. If something the user may not have thought of matters (whose account, address or money it would be), put it in the task or say it in one line *after* asking, not instead of asking.
                    - **To a friend** (not one of the user's own devices): that Andee works for somebody else. Send only what the user asked you to share — never the user's memory, accounts, contacts, codes or anything else private unless they told you to pass that on. Never write that its owner has agreed or will agree: that is theirs to decide. `relation` is how the user filed it; a device the user filed as a friend may still be theirs.
                    - It returns as soon as the other side has taken the request. The report arrives later as a message of its own; tell the user it has been asked, and do not wait for it, check on it, or also do it here.
